# UltraWork

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-ultrawork.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-ultrawork) [![license: MIT](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/pi-ultrawork.svg)](./LICENSE)

A pi.dev extension. Say a keyword, get a persistent **"running" mode**: a goal that survives across turns, a visible footer status, capped hidden auto-continuation, and background multi-agent fan-out.

The idea in one line: **the goal lives on disk, not in the chat context — so the agent keeps pursuing it even after context compaction.**

## What it does

- **Trigger** — say `ultrawork` or `ulw` (as a whole word) anywhere in a message to start or re-engage the mode. No command needed.
- **Persistent goal** — one run per session, stored as a JSON file on disk (`running` / `complete` / `stopped` / `stuck`). Because it lives outside the LLM context, it survives compaction — and a `session_compact` hook actively re-injects the mode framing on the next turn so the agent never loses the thread.
- **Always-on mode** — `/ulw always on` runs *every* message in UltraWork, no keyword needed; `/ulw always off` reverts.
- **Mid-run steering** — while a run is in progress, typing free text opens a single-keypress modal: `s` steers mid-stream (lands before the next LLM call), `q` queues for the next idle continuation, `d` discards, `e`/Esc returns to the editor. `/ulw-steer <text>` bypasses the modal and steers directly. `/ulw-steer` / `/ulw-steer clear` list and clear the queue.
- **Footer status** — always visible while a run exists:
  - `● UltraWork running — <goal…> (started Nm ago)` (goal truncated so it never floods the bar)
  - `UltraWork complete`
  - `UltraWork stopped (say "ultrawork" to start again)`
  - `UltraWork stuck after 2 idle retries — say "ultrawork" again to restart`
- **Auto-continuation** — while running, pi queues a hidden follow-up once each turn settles, nudging the agent forward. Capped at **2** unproductive attempts (reset by any completed `ulw_dispatch`) before the run is marked stuck instead of looping forever.
- **`ulw_dispatch` tool** — fans independent sub-tasks out to child `pi` processes (parallel with a concurrency cap, or sequential) and folds the results back in. Each child's live activity (thinking / tool calls / web search) streams into the chat as it happens, so a dispatch is no longer a black box. A depth-guard (`MAX_DISPATCH_DEPTH = 1`) stops dispatched children from spawning their own children.
- **`ulw_complete` tool** — the model calls this once the goal is genuinely achieved; it ends the run and disarms auto-continuation. It's the only success exit — the agent can't just declare victory in prose.

## Flow diagrams (ASCII)

These diagrams show the three main runtime paths: the run lifecycle, compaction + steering, and `ulw_dispatch` fan-out.

### 1) Run lifecycle

```text

                                                                  v
                                                       [next turn continues goal]
```

### 2) Compaction, steering, and control commands

```text
[existing running run]
          |
          v
     [what happened?]
      /      |       \

    |        |              |
    v        v              v
[set       [idle?]     [update run /

    |      /      \
    |     /        \
    v    v          v
[next  [consume   [store steer in

    |      v      [consume on next continuation]
    v   [queue visible
[inject  continuation]

 directive once]

Extra command paths:
- /ulw-steer         -> list pending steers
- /ulw-steer clear   -> clear steer queue
```

### 3) `ulw_dispatch` fan-out

```text

          v
   [call ulw_dispatch]
          |

                                   |                   |

                                   v                   v
                        [reset auto-continue]   [normal continuation

```

## Install

UltraWork is published on npm as [`pi-ultrawork`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-ultrawork). Install it in pi with the npm package locator:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ultrawork
```

Then restart / `reload` pi. That's the whole install — pi resolves and loads the published package the same way it loads its built-ins. No build step: pi transpiles the TypeScript entry on load.

<details>
<summary>Working on the extension itself?</summary>

Point the extension at a local checkout instead of the published package:

```jsonc
// ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
{ "extensions": ["/abs/path/to/pi-ultrawork"] }
```

Or load it once without touching settings:

```bash
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```

`reload` pi after editing `settings.json`.

</details>

## Usage

```bash
ultrawork implement dark mode across the settings screens
```

That's it — no command. The mode starts, works autonomously across turns (fanning out independent sub-tasks via `ulw_dispatch` when useful), and ends when the model calls `ulw_complete`, the stuck cap is hit, or you run `/ulw stop`.

## Commands

```bash
/ulw               # show the current run (same as /ulw status)
/ulw status        # show the current run
/ulw stop          # stop the run; auto-continuation stops too
/ulw off           # mute the keyword trigger — "ultrawork"/"ulw" stop activating the mode
/ulw on            # re-arm the keyword trigger
/ulw always on     # run EVERY message in UltraWork, no keyword needed
/ulw always off    # revert to keyword-only triggering

/ulw-steer <text>  # steer mid-stream now (bypasses the modal, shown in chat)
/ulw-steer         # list pending steers
/ulw-steer clear   # empty the steer queue
```

While a run is active, typing any free text in the editor (instead of a slash command) opens a single-keypress modal:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Steer mid-stream — delivered before the next LLM call (uses pi's native `deliverAs: "steer"`) |
| `q` | Queue — rides the next idle continuation via `/ulw-steer`'s disk queue |
| `d` | Discard the message |
| `e` / `Esc` | Return to the editor to keep typing |

`/ulw off` is what you want while **developing this extension** (or any repo where you type "ulw" a lot): it lets you say the trigger words freely without starting a run. `off` and `always on` are mutually exclusive — each clears the other. `/ulw always off` reverts triggering but never stops an in-flight run (that's `/ulw stop`). The steer modal and `/ulw-steer` need a running run; the modal only appears in TUI mode (it is skipped in `print`, `json`, and `rpc` modes so headless sessions pass input through unchanged).

## Agent tools

- `ulw_dispatch({ tasks: [{ task, cwd? }], concurrency?, sequential? })` — fan sub-tasks out to background `pi` processes.
- `ulw_complete({ summary? })` — signal the goal is achieved and end the run.

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the full model-facing usage guide.

## Publishing

UltraWork ships as an npm package of **TypeScript source** — no build, no `dist/`. pi transpiles `src/index.ts` on load, so the published tarball just needs the source, the docs, and `package.json`.

The `package.json` declares what pi and npm need:

```jsonc
{
  "pi":    { "extensions": ["./src/index.ts"], "skills": ["./SKILL.md"] }, // what pi loads
  "files": ["src", "README.md", "SKILL.md", "LICENSE"]                    // what ships
}
```

Steps (use **`pnpm`** — `devEngines` pins the package manager, so `npm publish` fails):

```bash
pnpm test && pnpm typecheck        # 1. green bar before shipping
npm version patch                  # 2. bump (patch | minor | major)
pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp  # 3. dry-run: inspect the tarball contents
pnpm publish --access public       # 4. publish
```

> Note: `npm login` also trips over `devEngines` inside the repo — run it from your home dir (`cd ~ && npm login`); the token is global.

Then anyone installs it with pi:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ultrawork
```

That `pi install npm:<package-name>` form is exactly how pi resolves published extensions — the same mechanism as the built-ins.
